# SOC-L1-Alert-Triage
This repository demonstrates findings and my hands‑on process for triaging SIEM alerts (inspired by the TryHackMe SOC L1 Alert Triage room). It mirrors the structure and deliverables you might present on GitHub to show recruiters or engineers how you handle alerts, investigate, and document outcomes.
