# SOC-L1-Alert-Triage
This repository demonstrates findings and my hands‑on process for triaging SIEM alerts (inspired by the TryHackMe SOC L1 Alert Triage room). It mirrors the structure and deliverables to show real life scenarios for alerts, investigations, and documentations used by SOC Analysts.

**Objectives:**
- Receive & Categorize Alerts
  - Investigate Logs, EDR, and Network
    - Document, Escalate, and close Alerts
